# Enhanced Test Plan for SAST Console API

## Overview
This test plan outlines enhanced testing for the SAST Console API, focusing on the accuracy of data displayed in the frontend. The tests will verify that the API responses match the expected data structure and content that will ultimately be displayed on various pages.

## Test Categories

### 1. Dashboard Tests
- Test fetching dashboard statistics (agent counts, task stats, vulnerability counts)
- Test retrieval of recent tasks and recent vulnerabilities
- Verify accurate counts by status category (pending, running, completed, failed)

### 2. Agents Tests
- Test fetching all agents with correct data structure
- Test agent registration with appropriate fields
- Test agent heartbeat mechanism
- Test agent status updates
- Verify that agent system information is correctly stored and retrieved
- Negative tests for agent data inconsistencies

### 3. Tasks Tests
- Test fetching all tasks with correct agent associations
- Test task creation with all required fields
- Test task status update transitions
- Test task filtering by status
- Test task associations with agents
- Negative tests for task data validation

### 4. Vulnerabilities Tests
- Test vulnerability data structure
- Test association of vulnerabilities with scan results and tasks
- Test filtering vulnerabilities by severity
- Test vulnerability metadata (scanner, confidence, file paths)
- Verify correct formatting of vulnerability details

## Implementation Strategy
1. Enhance existing tests to validate response structure matches frontend expectations
2. Add tests for data consistency between related endpoints
3. Create end-to-end scenarios that simulate user workflows
4. Add validation for all fields displayed in the frontend

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify and fix bugs related to data inconsistencies
- Ensure frontend displays accurate information
- Improve data validation in API endpoints
- Create more robust test coverage for the application
